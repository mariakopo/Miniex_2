•	Describe your coding process

For me learning how to program is very new and I can sometimes feel very confused and frustrated.  I think it is difficult for me to lean the programming-language, remember it and get to make a sense of it.
I have watched a lot of Daniel Shiffman’s tutorials and videos on YouTube since the videos are for beginners and are very educational to follow. 
My coding process started in the very basic instructions and I think that our miniex_2 - My First Program is affected by it because I am not a very advanced user of the coding language. 


•	What constitutes a program?

When you start programming it is important to understand the programming-language which has a defined syntax for the coding. So, you can say that the programming-language is essential for the coding. 
When you begin to understand the language for programming you can begin to experiment the world of coding and make exciting things and object. It is important that you have a lot of patience, willpower and perseverance because the start of programming can seem very confusing and you can therefore get frustrated.  


•	Reflect on the notion of error (what is error to you?)

Error can mean a lot of things and have a different meaning when you use it in contexts. You can make an error on purpose without it makes an overall error on the system. I guess an error on purpose can be compared to art if it has a specific meaning to it. It can be an error made for making a statement.
 An error can also be described as something where the syntax is not complete and therefore the whole program cannot be understood. The programming-language can therefore not read or understood and the system tells you that an error has been found. Therefore, you must solve the problem and find the error so the system or the program can be fixed. 
 

4)	Read Error, the Unforeseen, and the Emergent (2007) by Tim Barker, does it change your understanding of error? Perhaps we may think about the aesthetics of error?

Tim Backer describes in “Error, the Unforeseen, and the Emergent” (2007) that:
”In the condition where machinic systems seek the unforeseen and the emergent, there is also a possibility for the unforeseen error to slip into existence. This condition can be seen in the emerging tradition of artists using error as a creative tool.”

He talks about using an error as a creative tool which can be compared to using an error for art. Also, the glitches can be seen in the visual art. So, as the potential for error marks the potential for the new and the unforeseen, we can see that an error may be creative. It may be sought out and used to create the unforeseen within traditional systems, such as our routine computer use. 

Deleuze look at the unforeseen as surrounded by a cloud of the virtual. Lev Manovich describes the generative capabilities of error can be understood through his cultural communication model and through a post-digital cultural communication can be considered as:
SENDER - SOFTWARE - MESSAGE - SOFTWARE - RECEIVER

In this model the software, much more than the noise introduced by the communication channel, may change the message. Significantly, the software may introduce an error into the message.
Rather than thinking of the error as something to fear or avoid, we can think of an error as something that brings with it the capacity for the new and the unforeseen. 
We can picture a potential for error at every point that a system is opened to unformed information.

To conclude there is a lot of different descriptions for what describes an error or glitches. It can also be a very individual chase.
